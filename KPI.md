# Project Synopsis: Handling Large JSON Data with Kafka, Spark Streaming, and API Integration

### Executive Summary

This project aims to efficiently handle and process large JSON data files (up to 5MB) streamed from various devices. Using a combination of Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and a Flask API, the system will ingest, process, and compute Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The processed data will be stored temporarily and can be fetched from InfluxDB when necessary. The system will also include an hourly scheduler for regular KPI computations.

### Objectives

1. **Efficient Data Ingestion**: Utilize Apache Kafka to handle and ingest large JSON data streams from multiple devices.
2. **Real-time Data Processing**: Implement Apache Spark Streaming to process data in real-time and compute KPIs.
3. **Temporary Storage and Retrieval**: Store processed KPI data in temporary storage for quick access and fetch from InfluxDB if not available in temporary storage.
4. **API for KPI Retrieval**: Develop a Flask API to provide endpoints for retrieving computed KPIs.
5. **Scheduled Computations**: Implement an hourly scheduler to perform regular KPI computations.

### System Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Use Apache Kafka to handle data streams from devices.
   - Adjust Kafka configurations to allow large message sizes (up to 10MB).

2. **Real-time Data Processing**:
   - Utilize Apache Spark Streaming to read data from Kafka, filter by timestamp, and compute KPIs.
   - Store the processed data in a temporary location for quick access.

3. **API Integration**:
   - Develop a Flask API to provide endpoints for retrieving KPIs.
   - If requested data is not available in temporary storage, fetch it from InfluxDB and compute KPIs.

4. **Scheduled Computations**:
   - Use APScheduler to run hourly computations of KPIs, ensuring regular updates and availability of KPI data.

### Detailed Requirements

1. **Kafka Configuration**:
   - Increase `message.max.bytes` to 10MB in Kafka broker configuration.
   - Ensure Kafka producer configuration supports large messages.

2. **Spark Streaming Application**:
   - Define schema for incoming JSON data.
   - Filter and process data for specific timestamps.
   - Compute KPIs (e.g., average values) and store results in a temporary directory.

3. **Flask API Service**:
   - Implement endpoints to retrieve KPIs based on timestamps.
   - Check temporary storage for KPI data; if unavailable, fetch from InfluxDB.
   - Include error handling and efficient data retrieval mechanisms.

4. **InfluxDB Integration**:
   - Setup InfluxDB client for fetching data when required.
   - Define queries to retrieve and compute KPIs from InfluxDB data.

5. **Hourly Scheduler**:
   - Use APScheduler to set up an hourly job for KPI computations.
   - Ensure scheduler runs seamlessly with the Flask API service.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Kafka and Zookeeper**:
   - Install and configure Apache Kafka and Zookeeper.
   - Create Kafka topics for incoming device data.

2. **Develop Spark Streaming Application**:
   - Write Spark code to read from Kafka, process data, and compute KPIs.
   - Test the Spark application to ensure it handles large JSON data efficiently.

3. **Develop Flask API Service**:
   - Create API endpoints for KPI retrieval.
   - Implement logic to check temporary storage and fetch from InfluxDB if necessary.
   - Integrate APScheduler for hourly KPI computations.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the entire setup with sample data to ensure end-to-end functionality.
   - Validate performance and accuracy of KPI computations.

5. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
   - Deploy the system in the production environment.
   - Set up monitoring and logging to ensure system reliability and performance.

### Benefits

- **Scalability**: The system can handle large volumes of data and scale as needed.
- **Real-time Processing**: Provides real-time KPI computations for timely insights.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Temporary storage and fallback to InfluxDB ensure quick access to data.
- **Regular Updates**: Hourly computations ensure KPIs are up-to-date.

### Risks and Mitigations

1. **Data Volume**: High volumes of data might strain the system. 
   - **Mitigation**: Use partitioning and replication in Kafka to distribute load.

2. **System Reliability**: Failures in any component could disrupt the workflow.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling, logging, and monitoring.

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Processing large JSON files might cause delays.
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize Spark jobs and ensure efficient data handling.

### Conclusion

This project will leverage Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, and a Flask API to create a robust, scalable system for handling and processing large JSON data streams. By implementing efficient data ingestion, real-time processing, and scheduled computations, the system will provide timely and accurate KPIs, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency.
